# Hello, World! in Assembly

https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/508f5265-b7ac-4d56-9345-03ae517eaa1c

This document explains how to write, assemble, and run a "Hello, World!" program in x86-64 assembly on a Linux system.

## The Assembly Code (`hello.asm`)

```assembly
section .data
    hello db 'Hello, World!', 0ah

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; write(1, hello, 13)
    mov rax, 1
    mov rdi, 1
    mov rsi, hello
    mov rdx, 13
    syscall

    ; exit(0)
    mov rax, 60
    xor rdi, rdi
    syscall
```

### Code Explanation

- **`section .data`**: This section is for declaring initialized data.
  - `hello db 'Hello, World!', 0ah`: This defines a byte string named `hello` containing "Hello, World!" and a newline character (`0ah`).
- **`section .text`**: This section contains the program's code.
  - `global _start`: This makes the `_start` label visible to the linker, marking it as the program's entry point.
  - `_start:`: This is where the program begins execution.
- **Printing "Hello, World!"**: This part of the code uses a system call to write the string to the console.
  - `mov rax, 1`: Sets `rax` to `1`, the syscall number for `write`.
  - `mov rdi, 1`: Sets `rdi` to `1`, the file descriptor for `stdout`.
  - `mov rsi, hello`: Sets `rsi` to the memory address of our `hello` string.
  - `mov rdx, 13`: Sets `rdx` to `13`, the length of the string.
  - `syscall`: Executes the `write` system call.
- **Exiting the program**: This part of the code uses a system call to terminate the program.
  - `mov rax, 60`: Sets `rax` to `60`, the syscall number for `exit`.
  - `xor rdi, rdi`: Sets `rdi` to `0` (the exit code) by XORing it with itself.
  - `syscall`: Executes the `exit` system call.

## Assembling and Running

To run the assembly program, you need to assemble it into an object file and then link it to create an executable.

### Commands

1.  **Assemble with `nasm`**:
    ```bash
    nasm -f elf64 hello.asm -o hello.o
    ```
2.  **Link with `ld`**:
    ```bash
    ld hello.o -o hello
    ```
3.  **Run the executable**:
    ```bash
    ./hello
    ```

### Command Explanations

- `nasm -f elf64 hello.asm -o hello.o`: This command assembles the `hello.asm` file.
  - `nasm`: The Netwide Assembler.
  - `-f elf64`: Specifies the output format as ELF64, the standard for 64-bit Linux executables.
  - `hello.asm`: The input assembly file.
  - `-o hello.o`: Specifies the output object file name.
- `ld hello.o -o hello`: This command links the `hello.o` object file.
  - `ld`: The GNU linker.
  - `hello.o`: The input object file.
  - `-o hello`: Specifies the output executable file name.
- `./hello`: This command executes the `hello` program.

# Understanding Data Declaration Order in Assembly

Hey! Here is a simple explanation for how the order of lines in the `.data` section of an assembly file can change the program's output. It all comes down to how the assembler reads the code.

### The Core Concept: The Assembler Reads Top-to-Bottom

Think of the assembler as a program that reads your `.asm` file one line at a time, from top to bottom. As it reads, it calculates memory addresses and defines values.

The most important symbol for this explanation is the dollar sign: `$`

- **`$`**: This special symbol represents the **current memory address** where the assembler is working. Its value changes as the assembler moves down the file and allocates space for data.

### The Base Code

Here is the simple program we are looking at. It's designed to print a message to the screen.

```assembly
section .text
  global _start

    _start:
      mov edx, len    ; The length of the message
      mov ecx, msg    ; The message to write
      mov ebx, 1      ; File descriptor (1 for stdout)
      mov eax, 4      ; System call number (sys_write)
      int 0x80        ; Call the kernel

      mov eax, 1      ; System call number (sys_exit)
      int 0x80        ; Call the kernel

section .data
  msg db "12345", 0xa
  ; The next lines are what we will change
```

The key instruction is `len equ $ - msg`. This tells the assembler: "Create a constant called `len` and set its value to the current address (`$`) minus the starting address of `msg`."

---

### Case 1: Printing Only the First Message

In this case, we calculate the length _immediately_ after the first message.

#### The Code

```assembly
section .data
  msg db "12345", 0xa

  ; --- The important part ---
  len equ $ - msg
  msg2 times 5 db "6", 0xa
```

#### The Explanation

1.  The assembler reads `msg db "12345", 0xa` and allocates 6 bytes of memory.
2.  On the very next line, it sees `len equ $ - msg`. At this exact moment, the `$` symbol points to the memory address right after the `msg` string.
3.  The assembler calculates `len` as `(address after msg) - (address of msg)`, which equals **6**.
4.  Even though `msg2` is defined on the next line, it doesn't matter because the value of `len` has already been set in stone.
5.  The program runs and prints 6 bytes starting from `msg`.

#### Expected Output

```
12345
```

---

### Case 2: Printing Both Messages

In this case, we move the length calculation to the very end.

#### The Code

```assembly
section .data
  msg db "12345", 0xa
  msg2 times 5 db "6", 0xa

  ; --- The important part ---
  len equ $ - msg
```

#### The Explanation

1.  The assembler reads `msg db "12345", 0xa` (6 bytes).
2.  It then continues and reads `msg2 times 5 db "6", 0xa` (10 bytes).
3.  **Only after** processing both `msg` and `msg2` does it see `len equ $ - msg`. Now, the `$` symbol points to the memory address _after_ all the `msg2` data.
4.  The assembler calculates `len` as `(address after msg2) - (address of msg)`, which is the total combined length: **16 bytes**.
5.  The program runs and prints 16 bytes starting from `msg`. Since `msg2` is located right after `msg` in memory, it prints all of `msg` and then continues, printing all of `msg2` as well.

#### Expected Output

```
12345
6
6
6
6
6
```

### Summary of Our Discussion

You understood this perfectly. The key takeaway is that the assembler is not magic; it's a sequential program. The value of `$` is dynamic _during assembly time_, and the position of the `len equ $ - msg` line is what determines the final, constant value of `len` that gets baked into your executable. Your analysis of both cases was spot on.

That's a great question. You've touched on the _other_ half of data definition.

Here’s the key difference:

- `DB`, `DW`, `DD`, etc. **Define Data**. They allocate space _and_ put a specific value into it.
- `RESB`, `RESW`, `RESD`, etc. **Reserve Space**. They only allocate _empty_ space. They are for creating uninitialized variables that your program will fill in later.

Think of it like this:

- `DB`: `my_message: db 'Hello!'` ➡ Puts the bytes for 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\!' into the file.
- `RESB`: `user_input: resb 100` ➡ Skips 100 bytes of space, leaving an empty buffer. Your code can later read keyboard input and store it at the `user_input` address.

---

## How to Use Them (The `.bss` Section)

The correct way to use these `RESB` directives is in a special section called **`.bss`**.

Your binary file has different sections:

- **`.text`**: For your code (like `mov`, `jmp`).
- **`.data`**: For initialized data (like `db 'Hello'`). This data is saved _inside_ your executable file.
- **`.bss`**: For _uninitialized_ data (like `resb 100`). This data is _not_ saved in the file. It's just a note that says, "When you load this program, please set aside 100 bytes of empty memory for it." This keeps your executable file small.

### Example

Here is how you would use it in a program.

```asm
section .data
    ; --- Initialized data ---
    prompt_msg: db 'What is your name? ', 0


section .bss
    ; --- Reserved (uninitialized) space ---

    ; Reserve 100 bytes of space to store the user's name
    user_name: resb 100

    ; Reserve 1 word (2 bytes) to store the user's age
    user_age: resw 1

    ; Reserve 1 doubleword (4 bytes) for a counter
    login_attempts: resd 1


section .text
global _start

_start:
    ; ... your code would go here ...

    ; For example, you might:
    ; 1. Call a function to print 'prompt_msg'
    ; 2. Call a function to read keyboard input
    ; 3. Store the result at the 'user_name' address

    ; ... more code ...
```

In this example:

- `prompt_msg` is created using `db` because we know its value ("What is your name?") from the start.
- `user_name` is created using `resb 100` because we _don't_ know the user's name yet. We are just saving an empty 100-byte buffer for it.
- `user_age` is created using `resw 1` to hold a 2-byte number that we'll get from the user later.
- `login_attempts` is created using `resd 1` to hold a 4-byte number that our code will increment or reset.
